## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
 A breakpoint isn't something you add into your HTML, which is what I initially thought. It is a concept used when deciding what width to set as your boundary when creating @media rulesets in CSS.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Your column's will be inside some container, usually a row, and you want them to take up a certain part of that container. If everyone had the same size screen, you could use pixels, but since they don't percentages lets your page adhere to the constraints of a user's screen much beter than pixels.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Because CSS is 'cascading' meaning lower rules take precedence over higher, and since the two rules have overlap, the rule after simply overrides the rule before.
