## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A codeblock that you "pack up" and then can call through your program.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  You have the function keyword, an optional name, an optional list of parameters seperated my commas, the start of the code block '{', an optional return statement, and the end of the codeblock '}'
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The function name, and the arguments surrounded by parentheses.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The definition is much larger and contains all the code you want saved. The call is much smaller, only having the function name and the arguments you wish to be passed in (which is sometimes 0).
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  The parameter is the placeholder name for a variable that will be passed in when the function is called. The argument is that variable that you pass in when you call the function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters allow our functions to produce different results despite having the same codeblock. PArameters give you options to pass in arguments, which can change how your code runs.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Return stops any more code in the code block from running, and it lets our codeblock produce a value that we can make use of in our program.
