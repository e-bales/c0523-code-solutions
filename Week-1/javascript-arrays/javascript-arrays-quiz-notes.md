## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are arrays used for?
  When we want an order to storing our data.
- Describe array literal notation.
  You use square brackets, potentially filled with data seperated by commas, and an assignment operator assigning the array to a variable.
- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?
  Plain objects have no order to them, and you can think of array indeces (which are only ordered numbers) as being the 'keys', whereas keys can be any string in regular objects.
- What number represents the first index of an array?

0.

- What is the `length` property of an array?
  A number that is how many items are in the array.
- How do you calculate the last index of an array?
  array.length - 1;
