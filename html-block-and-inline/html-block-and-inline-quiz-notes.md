## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  Block level elements always begin on a new line and a margin is automatically added around the element
- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  Inline elements are named appropriately, as they don't start a new line and they only take up as much space as needed to fit the text.
- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
  The width is the size of the parent element (such as the screen size), and the height is the height of its contents.
- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  The width and height just of the content, nothing more.
