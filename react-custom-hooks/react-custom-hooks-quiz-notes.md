  Custom hooks are useful when you have a lot of shared logic between different components. Additionally, ypu can have different state, but the same logic, which is helpful for things like forms. They are not required if your task can be easily completed with an inbuilt hook.

  Start with 'use', followed by a capitalized word/phrase.
