- What does the `new` operator do?
  It allows us to create an instance of a user-defined object type
- What property of JavaScript functions can store shared behavior for instances created with `new`?
  The prototype
- What does the `instanceof` operator do?
  It returns a boolean that is true if a constructor's prototype property appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. In layman's terms, it checks if a provided object is "an instance of" the provided constructor type.
