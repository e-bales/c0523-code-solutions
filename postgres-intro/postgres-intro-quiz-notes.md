- Why do we use databases in Web development?
  Often times an application needs to keep track of information in order to run properly. While you can store data in files themselves, it is often easier and more efficient to use a database to keep hold of info.
- What is PostgreSQL and what are some alternative relational databases?
  PostgreSQL is an open-source relational databse management system that has been in development for over 30 years. Alternative relational databases are MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
- What are some advantages of learning a relational database?
  Learning relational databases means you also learn SQL, which allows you to quickly pick up other SQL databases. Additionally, data is often relational, and storing relational data in a relational database is very efficient. Also, many relational databases have good data integrity, which is critical for many applications.
- What is one way to see if PostgreSQL is running?
  sudo service postgresql status
