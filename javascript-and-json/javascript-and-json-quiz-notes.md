## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSON?
  It is a text-based data format that follows JavaScript object syntax, but can be used in other languages!
- What are serialization and deserialization?
  Serialization is the process of breaking down an object in memory into transferrable data so You can store it or send it. Deserialization is the process of turning that data back into an object you can manipulate in memory.
- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
  It lets us send information across the world and store information in a more efficient way. And if we serialize something, we of course need a way to get the object BACK, and so we have a use for deserialization.
- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using JavaScript?
  JSON.stringify(object);
- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using JavaScript?
  JSON.parse(string);
