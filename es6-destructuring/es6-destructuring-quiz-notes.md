## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring lets us grab information from objects and assign them to variables in a much less verbose way, decreasing the amount of code we have to write.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  let { property1: variable1, property2: variable2 } = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  let [ property1: variable1, property2: variable2 ] = array;
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  The easiest sign for me is that in destructuring, the curly/square brakcets are on the left of the assignment operator, whereas in creating literals, they are on the right.
