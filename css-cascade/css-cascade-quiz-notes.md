## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".
  Source Order, Inheritance, Specificity, and !important
- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
  'source order' refers to the order CSS rulesets appear in your stylesheet, and a lower ruleset in the source order will overpower a ruleset that appears higher on the sheet.
- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
  Through inheritance! Using the 'all' property or the 'inherit' value, you can play around with what gets inherited and what doesn't
- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
  TYPE, CLASS, ID
- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
  Using '!important' is a brute force way to get the specificity you want, when there are other, less abrasive ways to do so.
