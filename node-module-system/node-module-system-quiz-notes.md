After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a JavaScript module?
  A single .js file that should hopefully provide a small chunk of functionality. A program is then a result of (usually) multiple modules.

  Breaking down larger problems into smaller problems makes tackling a problem more manageable, and allows you to reuse code across different portions of your app easily without having to copy and past code everywhere.
- In JavaScript, how do you make a function in a module available to other modules?
  By exporting the function with the export keyword.
- In JavaScript, how do you use a function from another module?
  By importing the function with the import keyword.
