## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  To store information! We give varaibles names, and so therefore they can be thought of as 'named storage'
- How do you **declare** a variable?
  using 'let' or 'const' (or 'var') and then providing a name for the variable, with the name usually associated with what info the variable is storing.
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  By using the assignment operator '=' and providing data.
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  all letters, digits, underscores, and $
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  It means that the variable 'Cat' and the variable 'cat' are two different variables, despite being the same word to use human readers
- What is the purpose of a string?
  To store information as text!
- What is the purpose of a number?
  To store information numerically!
- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  To store binary information, often true/false.
- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  This is the assignment operator, assigning whatever data is on the right side, to the variable on the left side.
- How do you update the value of a variable?
  By using another assignment operator (or others such as +=, -=, etc.). Thsi sets the variable to be equal to whatever you provide on the right side of the operator.
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Null is intentionally assigned to variables to denote a lack of information, undefined is for when nothing is assigned to a variable. Additionally, null is technically an object, whereas undefined is not.
- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  When debugging, you will often have many console logs. To keep your code clear and easier to interpret, you add labels to know where and what you are logging.
- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  String, number, boolean, null, undefined!
