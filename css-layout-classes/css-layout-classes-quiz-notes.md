## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do two div elements "vertically stack" on one another by default?
  Div's are block elements, and therefore take up the full width of their parent. Therefore, the second div cannot appear next to the first div by default because the first div is taking up all that space.
- What is the default `flex-direction` of an element with `display: flex`?
  The default is set to 'row'
- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?)
  Container, rows, columns
- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**?
  1
- What is the purpose of a **container**?
  It 'contains' the layout and allows you to control aspects like width or margins that you want applied to your whole section.
