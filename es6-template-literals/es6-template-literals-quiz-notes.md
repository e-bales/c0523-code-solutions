# es6-template-literals-quiz-notes

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the syntax for writing a template literal?
  Template literals use backticks (`) to begin and end, and to substitute varaibles or expressions into the string, we use ${variable/expression}.
- What is "string interpolation"?
  String interpolation is substituting variable names or expressions into the template literal, rather than having to use string concatenation like with regular strings.
