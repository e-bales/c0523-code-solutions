## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the `express.json()` middleware do and when would you need it?
  It parses incoming requests automatically and puts the parsed data inside req.body for you to use/manipulate. You'd want to use this when you know you'll be passed data in the JSON format that you'll want to work with/save somewhere.
