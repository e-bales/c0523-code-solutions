## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the phases in the React design process?
  1. Identify in your UI mockup which pieces should be components.
  2. Determine which states are necessary for your mockup to become reality.
  3. Determine what you need to do to modify state, which components the events originate in, and how parent components should react.
- How does data flow in React?
  Data, and state, flows from parent to child through props.
- How can children components modify state in their parents?
  When child components are passed event handlers, whether it be clicking a button or typing in a field, these child components can modify the state of the parent component, often in our case 'App'.
